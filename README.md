# DevProcess Event - CodeBoost

An event held by the course (CodeBoost)[https://codeboost.com.br/], with the instructor: (Will Moreira)[https://github.com/WillMoreiraDev], front-end engineer, who currently `coda` for the agency (INSANY DESIGN ðŸ¤˜)[https://insany.design/].

The project consisted of developing a **God of War** game website for consoles. With a layout that has a lot of effects and many micro interactions.

### My objective

I've always liked the work carried out by the INSANY team, this agency is a source of inspiration for me!

My biggest interest in participating in this event was to try to understand a little of the techniques, methods and processes used by Will, as he has been following his work for years. And of course, get more technical knowledge hehe. :sweat_smile:

> Note.: At the time I participated in this event, I am going through a long period of studies in JavaScript and SQL. Having this contact with a project focused on front-end was a source of good knowledge.
